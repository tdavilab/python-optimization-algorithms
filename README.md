# Python Optimization Algorithms

In this project there are three optimization algorithms implemented in python, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and swarm optimization.
The output of these algoritms shows the value of the objective function after a defined number of iterations.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tdavilab/python-optimization-algorithms.git
cd python-optimization-algorithms
```


## Usage

### Ant colony optimization algorithm

The output of this algoritm gives a step-by-step solution and it runs it for 10 iterations.

```sh
python ant-colony-optimization.py
```

### Simulated annealing optimization algorithm

```sh
python simulated-annealing-optimization.py
```
### Swarm optimization algorithm

```sh
python swarm-optimization.py
```


To change the objective function you have to edit the variable in the source code. You can also edit the type of the problem, maximization or minimization, and the phi function, which consists of the objective function and the restrictions of the problem.
